# About

The camlispp project provides camlistore services and components written in c++.

For more information on what camlistore is and how it works, see: [https://camlistore.org/](https://camlistore.org/)

# Goals and Motivation

This project was kicked off to get me back into the world of c++. I've been following the camlistore project for a little while now and believe that some great things will come from it.

# Roadmap

1. Implement a blob storage daemon. (in-progress)
1. Implement a schema daemon.
1. Implement the index-search daemon.

# Blob Storage Daemon

## Options and Configuration

Some compile-time options include:

* **ENABLE_DEBUG**: Enables general debugging. Without this, very little will be logged.
* **ENABLE_DUMP**: Enables extra dumping of internal objects (blob index, blob, blob key, etc).
* **ENABLE_MD5**: Enables use of md5 to has blobs, enabled by default. Can be turned off because md5 isn't that strong.
* **ENABLE_STATIC**: Enables use of static site, mostly for debugging. This is enabled by default.
* **ENABLE_DEBUG_LOAD**: Enables a feature that will attempt to create blobs for all files in a given directory.

Some run-time options include:

```
  --help                 produce help message
  --directory arg        The directory to save blobs in and serve them from
  --ip arg               The ip address to bind to
  --port arg             The port to serve requests on
  --threads arg          The number of threads to use
  --static_directory arg The directory to serve static files from
  --load_directory arg   The directory to load data from
```

## Testing

    $ ./blobserver/src/blobserver --port 8081 --directory /home/ngerakines/projects/camlispp/blobserver/data1/ --static_directory /home/ngerakines/projects/camlispp/blobserver --load_directory /home/ngerakines/projects/camlispp/blobserver/src/

    $ ./blobserver/src/blobserver --port 8082 --directory /home/ngerakines/projects/camlispp/blobserver/data2/ --static_directory /home/ngerakines/projects/camlispp/blobserver --sync http://127.0.0.1:8081


# Errata

Please use the following astyle config when contributing:

    alias style='astyle -A2 --indent=tab -C -N -Y -f -F -xd -j -J -p -H -n'

To enable object dumping for debug, use the following options when generating build files:

    cmake . -DENABLE_DEBUG=ON -DENABLE_DUMP=ON -DENABLE_DEBUG_LOAD=ON
